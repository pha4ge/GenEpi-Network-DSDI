Data Standards and Data Integration Working Group

The Data Structures & Data Integration Working Group focuses on the development of contextual (meta)data standards related to infectious diseases. The working group’s primary objective is to collaboratively establish open-source, purpose-driven standards within the community. Upon adoption, these standards will enhance interoperability, transparency, reproducibility, and improve the efficacy of meta-analyses.
